## About this repository
This repository contains all the files for our final project of the course "Experimental Psychology Lab". The project is a web-based experiment, a replication of the study "Give me gestalt! Preference for cubist artworks revealing high detectability of objects" (Muth et al, 2012).

## About the experiment
We want to investigate whether the viewers’ appreciation of cubist artwork is closely linked to the viewers’ ability to identify an object, or Gestalt, from partial clues. Therefore we examine if participants without expertise in cubism like cubist artworks more if they are able to detect concealed objects in them.
It is interesting to know whether there is a positive correlation between detectability and preference. We want to do the replication to investigate whether or not our results are similar to the results of the original study.
We have 3 hypotheses:
* Hypothesis 1: Viewers prefer paintings in which they are able to detect more ‘objects’.
* Hypothesis 2: How much a viewer likes a painting is significantly affected by its color.
* Hypothesis 3: How much a viewer likes a painting is significantly affected by its artist (which stands for its style).
